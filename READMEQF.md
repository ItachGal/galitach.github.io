# Privacy Policy for QuickFix Games

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

**QuickFix Games** ("the App") is developed and owned by **Gal Itach** ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our mobile application.

By downloading and using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Data Collected Automatically (Third Parties)
We do not operate a proprietary server or backend database. However, the App utilizes third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or your device to provide functionality (such as advertisements and leaderboards).

The third-party service providers used by the App include:

*   **Google AdMob:** Used to display advertisements. Google may use your device's Advertising ID (IDFA) to show personalized ads based on your interests.
*   **Apple Game Center:** Used for leaderboards and achievements. Apple collects data regarding your game activity.
*   **Apple StoreKit:** Used for In-App Purchases.

### B. Data Stored Locally
The App stores game progress (scores, Bit-Bot level, unlocked items, currency) locally on your device using Apple's `UserDefaults` and `AppStorage`. This data is not transmitted to us and remains on your device unless you choose to back it up via iCloud.

## 2. Device Permissions

To function correctly, QuickFix Games requires access to specific device features:

*   **Motion & Fitness (Accelerometer/Gyroscope):** The App uses motion sensors for gameplay mechanics (e.g., "Tilt" and "Shake" games). This motion data is processed in real-time on your device and is **never** recorded, stored, or transmitted to any server.
*   **App Tracking Transparency (ATT):** On iOS 14.5+, we request permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. This is strictly for delivering relevant advertisements via Google AdMob. You may decline this permission and still play the game.

## 3. In-App Purchases

The App offers In-App Purchases (e.g., "QuickFix Pro").
*   All transactions are processed securely by **Apple**.
*   We **do not** have access to your credit card information, billing address, or financial details.
*   Payment processing is subject to Apple's [Media Services Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/).

## 4. Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
*   The App is configured with Google AdMob's "Child-Directed Treatment" tags where appropriate.
*   If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.

## 5. GDPR and CCPA Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your data:
*   **Opt-Out of Tracking:** You can opt-out of personalized ads by disabling "Allow Apps to Request to Track" in your iOS Settings -> Privacy -> Tracking.
*   **Data Deletion:** Since your game progress is stored locally on your device, simply **deleting the App** will remove all local data associated with QuickFix Games from your device.

## 6. Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites (via advertisements). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
