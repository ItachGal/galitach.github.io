## **Privacy Policy**

### Our Privacy Philosophy

Our philosophy is to respect your privacy and handle as little information as possible.

*   **We Do Not Collect Your Personal Information:** Word Wise does not require you to create an account, and we do not collect, store, or share personal information like your name or email.
*   **Your Progress is Stored Only On Your Device:** All your game progress, including completed words, points, unlocked stickers, and settings, is saved **exclusively on your device**. This data is never sent to us or any third-party server.

### 1. Information Handled by Third-Party Partners

To provide core features, stability, and keep the App running, we integrate trusted services from Google. We do not have direct access to the raw data they collect.

#### a) Google AdMob (Advertisements)
To keep Word Wise free, we show ads through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.

*   **Data Handled:** This may include your device's advertising identifier (GAID), device model, operating system, IP address (for approximate location), and information on how you interact with ads.
*   **Your Control:** You can opt out of personalized ads by going to your device's **Settings > Google > Ads** and selecting **"Delete advertising ID."** You may still see generic (non-personalized) ads.

#### b) Google Play Billing (In-App Purchases)
If you make a purchase or receive a promotional item (like the pre-registration reward), the transaction is processed securely by Google Play. We do not collect or store any of your financial information. We only receive a confirmation from Google that a purchase was completed, which allows us to unlock the corresponding features or items in the App.

#### c) Google Play Console (Analytics & Crash Reporting)
To identify bugs and fix crashes, we use the standard reporting tools provided by the Google Play Console. If the App crashes, the Android operating system may collect an anonymized report including device type, OS version, and a technical crash log. This data does not contain personally identifiable information and is used solely to improve the App's stability.

### 2. Children's Privacy

Word Wise is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your region). We recommend parents supervise their children's use of the application and interaction with any third-party services.

### 3. Security

Your local game data is protected by your device's built-in security. For data handled by our third-party partners (Google), they are responsible for employing industry-standard security measures.

### 1. Virtual Items

The App may include virtual items such as points, stickers, or other digital rewards ("Virtual Items").

*   **No Monetary Value:** You acknowledge that Virtual Items have no cash value, are not redeemable for any sum of money, and cannot be transferred or sold.
*   **Limited License:** We grant you a limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable license to use Virtual Items within the App for your entertainment. You have no other right, title, or ownership interest in them.
*   **Local Storage and Data Loss:** All Virtual Items and game progress are stored exclusively on your device. Consequently, **if you uninstall the App, all your Virtual Items and progress will be permanently deleted and cannot be restored.** We do not have access to your device's storage and have no ability to recover lost data.

### 2. Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided for entertainment purposes on an **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"** basis.

We make no warranty of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any information or functionality within the App. We do not warrant that the App will be error-free, bug-free, or uninterrupted.

### 3. Limitation of Liability

**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE APP OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED. YOUR USE OF THE APP IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.

### 4. Changes to This Document

We may update this Privacy Policy & Terms of Service from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new document within the App or on its store listing. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
