**Effective Date:** August 2025

Thank you for using Word Wise ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information is handled when you use our application ("App").

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is to respect your privacy and collect as little information as possible.

*   **We Do Not Collect Personal Information:** Word Wise does not require you to create an account, and we do not collect, store, or share any personal information like your name, email, or location.
*   **Your Progress is Stored Locally:** All your game progress, including completed words, points, and settings, is saved **only on your device**. This data is never sent to us or any third-party server.
*   **Third-Party Services:** To provide core features, the App uses trusted third-party services from Google for advertisements, in-app purchases, app updates, and crash analytics. These services may collect data as described below.

### 1. Information We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other personal files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Account or login credentials.

### 2. Information Handled by Third-Party Partners

To support the App's functionality, stability, and keep it free, we integrate services from Google. We do not have direct access to the raw data they collect.

#### a) Google AdMob (Advertisements)
To keep Word Wise free, we show ads through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. This is why the App requests the `INTERNET` and `AD_ID` permissions.

Types of data AdMob may collect include:
*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's advertising identifier (GAID), device model, operating system, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address.
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with ads shown in the App.

We encourage you to review Google's policies to understand how they handle your data:
*   **How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:** [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

#### b) Google Play Billing (In-App Purchases)
If you choose to purchase the PRO version of Word Wise, the transaction is processed securely by Google Play. This is why the App requests the `BILLING` permission. We do not collect or store any of your financial information. We only receive a confirmation from Google that a purchase was completed, which allows us to unlock the PRO features in the App.

#### c) Google Play Console (Analytics & Crash Reporting)
To understand app performance, identify bugs, and fix crashes, we use the standard reporting tools provided by the Google Play Console. If the App crashes, the Android operating system may collect an anonymized report. This data is aggregated and includes information such as device type, operating system version, and the technical crash log (stack trace). This data does not contain any personally identifiable information and is used solely for improving the stability and performance of the App.

### 3. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

You have direct control over personalized advertising and diagnostic data sharing on your device.

To opt out of personalized ads on Android:
1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.

This will prevent apps, including Word Wise, from using your advertising ID for personalized ads. You may still see generic ads. You can also manage your device's overall usage and diagnostics sharing settings within your main Android Settings menu.

### 4. Children's Privacy

Word Wise is designed for a general audience and is not primarily directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. We recommend that parents and guardians supervise their children's use of the application and their interaction with any third-party services, such as advertisements. If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of our app, please contact us.

### 5. Security

Your game progress data is stored exclusively on your device and is protected by your device's built-in security measures. For data handled by our third-party partners (Google), they are responsible for employing industry-standard security measures to protect that information.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on its store listing. We recommend you review this policy periodically.
