# Privacy Policy for GeoMinds

**Effective Date:** September 2025

Thank you for using GeoMinds, developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information is handled when you use our application ("App").

---

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is simple: we create safe, fun experiences by collecting as little information as possible.

*   **We Collect Nothing Personal:** GeoMinds does not require you to create an account, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location.

*   **Your Progress is Yours:** All your game progress, scores, and unlocked items are saved **only on your device**. This data is never sent to us or any server.

*   **Ads Keep the App Free:** To support the App's development and keep it free for everyone, we show ads through our partner, Google AdMob, for non-premium users.

*   **Third-Party Data Collection:** Google AdMob is the only third party that may collect data through our App to serve you relevant ads.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Account or login credentials.

### 2. Data Collected by Our Advertising Partner (Google AdMob)

To provide relevant ads and support our App for non-premium users, we use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). AdMob is a third-party service that collects and processes data to serve advertisements.

The types of data AdMob may collect include:

*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique advertising identifier (e.g., GAID), device model, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address (e.g., country or city).
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with the ads shown in the App, such as views and clicks.
*   **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data related to the Ads SDK.

This information is used by Google to provide advertising and to measure the performance of ad campaigns. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.

We strongly encourage you to review Google's policies to understand how they handle your data:
*   **How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:** [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

### 3. In-App Purchases and Data Portability

GeoMinds offers optional in-app purchases through the Google Play Store. It is important to understand how these purchases and related data are managed:

*   **"Go Premium" (Non-Consumable Purchase):** This is a one-time purchase that provides permanent benefits, such as removing banner ads. This purchase is tied to your Google Play account and will be automatically restored if you reinstall the App on any device using the same Google account.

*   **Gem Packs (Consumable Purchases):** Gems are consumable items that can be used within the App to unlock features or content. To protect your privacy, your gem balance and all game progress (including scores and collected countries) are stored **exclusively on your device**. This data is not stored on our servers and is not linked to your Google account.

*   **Data Loss on Reinstallation:** Because consumable items and game progress are stored locally, **if you uninstall the App, switch to a new device, or clear the App's data, this information—including any remaining gem balance and items acquired with gems—will be permanently lost and cannot be restored.**

### 4. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

You have direct control over your data and can opt out of personalized advertising at any time.

To manage your advertising preferences on your Android device:
1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.

This action will prevent apps on your device, including GeoMinds, from using your advertising ID to build profiles or show you personalized ads. You may still see ads, but they will be generic and not based on your interests.

### 5. Children's Privacy

GeoMinds is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction).

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information through an advertising partner, please contact us at the email address provided below. We will work with you and our partners to address the issue.

### 6. Security

The data the App saves (your game progress and gem balance) is stored on your device's internal storage. Because this data is never transmitted to an external server, it is protected by the security of your own device. For data handled by Google AdMob, Google employs industry-standard security measures to protect that information.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. We recommend you review this page periodically for any changes.
