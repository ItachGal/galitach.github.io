# Privacy Policy for GeoMinds

**Effective Date:** September 2025

Thank you for using GeoMinds, developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy, especially the privacy of our youngest players. This policy explains what information is handled when you use our application ("App").

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is simple: we create safe, fun experiences by collecting as little information as possible.

*   **We Collect Nothing Personal:** GeoMinds does not require you to create an account, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location.

*   **Your Progress is Yours:** All your game progress, scores, and unlocked items are saved **only on your device**. This data is never sent to us or any server.

*   **Ads Keep the App Free:** To support the App's development and keep it free for everyone, we show ads through our partner, Google AdMob.

*   **Third-Party Data Collection:** Google AdMob is the only third party that may collect data through our App to serve you relevant ads.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Account or login credentials.

### 2. Data Collected by Our Advertising Partner (Google AdMob)

To provide relevant ads and support our App, we use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). AdMob is a third-party service that collects and processes data to serve advertisements.

The types of data AdMob may collect include:

*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique advertising identifier (e.g., GAID), device model, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address (e.g., country or city).
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with the ads shown in the App, such as views and clicks.
*   **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data related to the Ads SDK.

This information is used by Google to provide advertising and to measure the performance of ad campaigns. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.

We strongly encourage you to review Google's policies to understand how they handle your data:
*   **How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:** [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

### 3. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

You have direct control over your data and can opt out of personalized advertising at any time.

To manage your advertising preferences on your Android device:
1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.

This action will prevent apps on your device, including GeoMinds, from using your advertising ID to build profiles or show you personalized ads. You may still see ads, but they will be generic and not based on your interests.

### 4. Children's Privacy

GeoMinds is designed for a general audience, including children. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable regulations. We have configured our ad settings through Google AdMob to treat ad requests for users in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland as directed for users under the age of consent, and we have designated our app as "child-directed" to enable Google's tools for compliance.

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through an ad network, please contact us, and we will work with you to address the issue.

### 5. Security

The data the App saves (your game progress) is stored on your device's internal storage. Because this data is never transmitted to an external server, it is protected by the security of your own device. For data handled by Google AdMob, Google employs industry-standard security measures to protect that information.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. We recommend you review this page periodically for any changes.
