### Privacy Policy for GeoMinds

**Effective Date:** October 2025

Thank you for using GeoMinds, developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information is handled when you use our application ("App").

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is simple: we create safe, fun experiences by collecting as little information as possible.

*   **We Collect Nothing Personal Directly:** GeoMinds does not require you to create an account with us, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location on our own servers.

*   **Your Progress is Yours:** By default, all your game progress, scores, and unlocked items are saved **only on your device**.

*   **Optional Cloud Sync:** If you choose to sign in with **Google Play Games**, your core progress (scores, achievements, collected countries) is synced to your Google account, allowing you to restore it on other devices. Your gem balance remains local to your device and is **not** synced.

*   **Ads Keep the App Free:** To support the App's development, we show ads through our partner, **Google AdMob**. Your consent for personalized ads is managed via Google's User Messaging Platform.

*   **Third-Party Data Collection:** Google (AdMob and Play Games Services) is the only third party that may collect data through our App.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data on our own servers. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.

### 2. Data Collected by Our Partners (Google)

To provide core features like advertising, achievements, and cloud saves, we integrate with Google's services.

#### a) Advertising (Google AdMob & User Messaging Platform)

We use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) to serve ads. To comply with privacy regulations, we also use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request your consent for personalized advertising.

The types of data AdMob may collect include:

*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique advertising identifier (e.g., GAID), device model, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address.
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with ads.
*   **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data related to the Ads SDK.

This information is used by Google to provide advertising and measure its performance. We do not have access to or control over this data. We strongly encourage you to review Google's policies:
*   **How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:** [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

#### b) Achievements & Cloud Saves (Google Play Games Services)

GeoMinds offers an **optional** sign-in feature using Google Play Games Services to provide you with achievements, leaderboards, and cloud saves. If you choose to sign in, Google will collect and process data associated with your Google Account, including:

*   **Google Account Information:** Your name, email address, and profile picture.
*   **Google Play Games Profile:** Your Gamer ID and public profile information.
*   **Game Activity:** Data about your achievements, scores, and saved game progress.

This allows you to sync your non-consumable game progress across devices. For more information, please review the **Google Play Games Services Terms of Service** and **Google Privacy Policy**.

### 3. Data Storage, Portability, and Deletion

It is crucial to understand how your data is stored:

*   **"Go Premium" (Non-Consumable Purchase):** This one-time purchase is tied to your Google Play account and will be automatically restored if you reinstall the App on any device using the same Google account.

*   **Game Progress (Scores, Achievements, Collected Countries):**
    *   **If you are NOT signed in:** This data is stored **only on your device** and will be permanently lost if you uninstall the App or clear its data.
    *   **If you ARE signed in with Google Play Games:** This data is synced to Google's servers as a "Saved Game." It can be restored on a new device by signing in with the same Google account.

*   **Gem Packs (Consumable Purchases):** Your gem balance is **always stored locally on your device** and is **NEVER synced to the cloud**, even if you are signed in.
    *   **Data Loss Warning:** If you uninstall the App, switch to a new device, or clear the App's data, your gem balance **will be permanently lost and cannot be restored.**

### 4. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

#### a) Personalized Advertising

You can opt out of personalized advertising at any time.
1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.

You may still see ads, but they will be generic. You can also manage your consent choices for ads within the App's settings menu where available.

#### b) Google Play Games Data & Deletion

You can manage the data associated with your Google Play Games profile, including deleting your GeoMinds game data.
1.  Go to your Google Account's **"Third-party apps with account access"** page.
2.  Select **GeoMinds** from the list.
3.  Click **"Delete all connections you have with GeoMinds"**.

This will remove the App's access to your account and instruct Google to delete your associated game data (achievements, scores, cloud saves).

### 5. Children's Privacy

GeoMinds is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through our advertising or gaming partners, please contact us at the email below.

### 6. Security

Game data stored on your device is protected by your device's own security measures. For data handled by Google, they employ industry-standard security measures to protect that information.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
