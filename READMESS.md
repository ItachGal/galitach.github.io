# Privacy Policy for Santa's Gift Stack: Christmas Game

**Effective Date:** October 2025

Thank you for playing Santa's Gift Stack: Christmas Game ("App"), developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a transparent experience. This policy explains how information is handled when you use our App.

---

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is to create a safe, festive experience by collecting as little information as possible.

*   **We Do Not Collect Your Personal Information:** The App does not require you to create an account with us, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location.

*   **Your Progress is Synced Securely (Optional):** Your game progress is saved on your device. If you choose to sign in with Google Play Games, your progress (high score, gems, premium status, etc.) is also saved to Google's secure cloud. This allows you to sync your progress across devices and protects it from being lost.

*   **Ads Keep the App Free:** To support the App's development, we show ads through our partner, Google AdMob, for non-premium users.

*   **Third-Party Services:** We use Google services for ads (AdMob), in-app purchases (Play Billing), and game features like leaderboards, achievements, and cloud saves (Play Games Services). These are the only third parties that may collect data through our App.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other personal files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Financial information (all payments are processed by Google).
*   Account or login credentials created with us.

### 2. Data Collected by Our Partners

To provide a full-featured and sustainable game, we integrate services from Google. Each service handles data according to its own privacy policy.

#### a) Google AdMob (Advertising)
To provide relevant ads and support our App for non-premium users, we use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). The types of data AdMob may collect include:

*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique advertising identifier (GAID), device model, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address (e.g., country or city).
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with the ads shown in the App.
*   **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data related to the Ads SDK.

This information is used by Google to provide advertising and measure its performance. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob. We encourage you to review **[How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)**.

#### b) Google Play Games Services (Achievements, Leaderboards & Cloud Save)
This is an **optional** service you can sign into. If you choose to sign in, Google will handle certain data to provide game features:

*   **Your public Google Play Games profile information** (e.g., Gamer ID and avatar) may be visible to other players on leaderboards.
*   **Your game activity,** such as your high scores (for leaderboards) and unlocked achievements.
*   **Your game save file** is uploaded to Google's servers for the Cloud Save feature.

This service is governed by the **[Google Play Games Services Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)** and the main **[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)**.

#### c) Google Play Billing (In-App Purchases)
The App offers an optional one-time "Premium" upgrade. All transactions are processed securely by the Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any of your financial information, such as credit card numbers. We only receive a confirmation from Google that a purchase has been completed.

### 3. Cloud Save & Data Portability

*   **"Go Premium" (Non-Consumable Purchase):** This is a one-time purchase that provides permanent benefits, such as removing certain ads. This purchase is tied to your Google Play account and will be automatically restored if you reinstall the App on any device using the same Google account.

*   **Cloud Save (Optional):** If you sign in to Google Play Games, your progress is automatically saved to the cloud. If you install the App on a new device and sign in with the same account, your progress will be restored. If there is a conflict between your local save and your cloud save, you will be prompted to choose which one to keep.

*   **Data Loss Without Cloud Save:** If you **do not** sign in to Google Play Games, all your game progress is stored **exclusively on your device**. If you uninstall the App, switch to a new device, or clear the App's data, this information **will be permanently lost and cannot be restored.**

### 4. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

You have direct control over your data.

*   **Personalized Advertising:** You can opt out of personalized advertising at any time.
    1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
    2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
    3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.
    You may still see ads, but they will be generic.

*   **Google Play Games Services:** You can disconnect the App from Google Play Games Services at any time through the Google Settings on your device or within the Google Play Games app. Doing so will disable Cloud Save, Leaderboards, and Achievements.

### 5. Children's Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information through our advertising partners, please contact us at the email below.

### 6. Security

Game data is stored on your device's internal storage and is protected by your device's security. If you use Google Play Games Services, your data is also protected by Google's industry-standard security infrastructure.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on its store listing. We recommend you review this policy periodically.
