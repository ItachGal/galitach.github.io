# Privacy Policy for Tfilati

**Effective Date:** [October, 2025]

Thank you for using Tfilati, developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a trustworthy spiritual tool. This policy explains what information is handled when you use our application ("App").

---

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is simple: your spiritual journey is private. We collect as little information as possible.

*   **We Collect Nothing Personal:** Tfilati does not require you to create an account, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location.

*   **Your App Data is Yours:** All your application data, such as your preferred font size, is saved **only on your device**. This data is never sent to us or any server.

*   **Ads Support the App:** To support the App's development and keep it free for everyone, we show ads through our partner, Google AdMob.

*   **Third-Party Data Collection:** Google AdMob is the only third party that may collect data through our App to serve you relevant ads.

---

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Account or login credentials.

### 2. Data Collected by Our Advertising Partner (Google AdMob)

To provide relevant ads and support our App, we use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). AdMob is a third-party service that collects and processes data to serve advertisements.

The types of data AdMob may collect include:

*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique advertising identifier (e.g., GAID), device model, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address (e.g., country or city).
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with the ads shown in the App, such as views and clicks.
*   **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data related to the Ads SDK.

This information is used by Google to provide personalized advertising and to measure the performance of ad campaigns. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.

We strongly encourage you to review Google's policies to understand how they handle your data:
*   **How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services:** [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)

### 3. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

You have direct control over your data and can opt out of personalized advertising at any time.

To manage your advertising preferences on your Android device:
1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.

This action will prevent apps on your device, including Tfilati, from using your advertising ID to build profiles or show you personalized ads. You may still see ads, but they will be generic and not based on your interests.

### 4. Children's Privacy

Tfilati is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your country). We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through an ad network, please contact us, and we will work with you to address the issue.

### 5. Security

The data the App saves (such as your preferred font size) is stored on your device's internal storage. Because this data is never transmitted to an external server, it is protected by the security of your own device. For data handled by Google AdMob, Google employs industry-standard security measures to protect that information.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. We recommend you review this page periodically for any changes.
