# Privacy Policy for MilimLi

**Effective Date:** November 2025

Thank you for using MilimLi ("App"), developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how information is handled when you use our App.

---

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is to create a safe, engaging, and educational experience by collecting as little information as possible.

*   **We Do Not Collect Your Personal Information:** The App does not require you to create an account with us, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location.
*   **Your Progress is Synced Securely (Optional):** Your game progress is saved on your device. If you choose to sign in with Google Play Games, your progress is also saved to Google's secure cloud.
*   **Camera for AR is Local-Only:** The Augmented Reality (AR) feature uses your camera, but the video feed is processed only on your device to display game elements. We do not record, store, or transmit any images or video from your camera.
*   **Ads Keep the App Free:** We show ads through Google AdMob. You can make a one-time Premium purchase to remove ads permanently.
*   **In-App Purchases are Handled by Google:** All purchases are processed securely through the Google Play Store. We never see or store your payment information.
*   **Anonymous Analytics Help Us Improve:** We use Google Analytics for Firebase to understand how the App is used. This data is anonymous, aggregated, and helps us make the App better.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos (except for temporary, on-device processing for AR features), calendars, or other personal files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Financial or payment information.
*   Account or login credentials created with us.

### 2. Camera and Augmented Reality (AR) Usage

The App includes an optional AR game feature that requires access to your device's camera. Our use of the camera is strictly limited to the following:

*   The camera feed is used in real-time, on your device only, to overlay virtual game elements onto your physical environment.
*   **We do not record, store, transmit, or share any images, videos, or data from your camera feed.** The camera data is processed locally and discarded immediately after it is used for rendering the AR effect.

### 3. Data Handled by Third-Party Services

To provide a full-featured and sustainable educational app, we integrate services from Google. Each service handles data according to its own privacy policy.

#### a) Google AdMob (Advertising)
We use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) to serve ads. The types of data AdMob may collect include device information, approximate location, and ad interactions. This information is used by Google to provide advertising and measure its performance. We encourage you to review **[How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)**.

#### b) Google Play Games Services (Achievements, Leaderboards & Cloud Save)
This is an **optional** service. If you sign in, Google will handle your public profile information, game activity, and game save file for cloud sync. This service is governed by the **[Google Play Games Services Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)** and the main **[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)**.

#### c) Google Play Billing (In-App Purchases)
When you make an in-app purchase, the transaction is processed securely by the Google Play Store. We **do not** collect, receive, or store any of your payment information. This process is governed by the **[Google Payments Terms of Service](https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/u/0/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=buyertos)**.

#### d) Google Analytics for Firebase (App Usage Analytics)
We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymous, non-personal, and aggregated data about how you interact with our App (e.g., which games are popular, crash reports). This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally.

### 4. Data Storage and Your Control

*   **Cloud Save (Optional):** If you sign in to Google Play Games, your progress is saved to the cloud.
*   **Data Loss Without Cloud Save:** If you **do not** sign in, all your game progress is stored **exclusively on your device**. If you uninstall the App, switch to a new device, or clear the App's data, this information **will be permanently lost and cannot be restored.**
*   **Personalized Advertising:** You can opt out of personalized advertising at any time by opening your device's **Settings** app, navigating to **Google** > **Ads**, and tapping **"Delete advertising ID"**.

### 5. Children's Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience, including children. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable regulations like GDPR-K.

*   We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction).
*   For users identified as children, Google AdMob is configured to serve non-personalized advertisements.
*   Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their children's use of the App.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on its store listing.
