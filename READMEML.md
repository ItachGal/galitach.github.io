# Privacy Policy for MilimLi

**Effective Date:** October 2025

Thank you for using MilimLi ("App"), developed by **Gal Itach** ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a transparent, engaging, and educational experience. This policy explains how information is handled when you use our App.

---

## Your Privacy at a Glance

Our philosophy is to create a safe, engaging, and educational experience by collecting as little information as possible.

*   **We Do Not Collect Your Personal Information:** The App does not require you to create an account with us, and we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information like your name, email, or location.

*   **Your Progress is Synced Securely (Optional):** Your game progress is saved on your device. If you choose to sign in with Google Play Games, your progress (score, gems, unlocked items, etc.) is also saved to Google's secure cloud. This allows you to sync your progress across devices.

*   **Ads Keep the App Free:** To support the App's development, we show ads through our partner, Google AdMob. You can optionally watch a rewarded ad to remove banner ads for 24 hours.

*   **Third-Party Services:** We use Google services for ads (AdMob) and game features like leaderboards, achievements, and cloud saves (Play Games Services). These are the only third parties that may collect data through our App.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect, request, or have access to any of your personal data. This includes:
*   Name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
*   Contacts, photos, calendars, or other personal files on your device.
*   Precise GPS location.
*   Financial or payment information.
*   Account or login credentials created with us.

### 2. Data Collected by Our Partners

To provide a full-featured and sustainable educational app, we integrate services from Google. Each service handles data according to its own privacy policy.

#### a) Google AdMob (Advertising)
To provide relevant ads and support our App, we use the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). This includes banner advertisements and optional rewarded advertisements that you may choose to watch in exchange for in-app benefits. The types of data AdMob may collect include:

*   **Device Information:** Such as your device's unique advertising identifier (GAID), device model, operating system version, and IP address.
*   **Approximate Location:** Inferred from your IP address (e.g., country or city).
*   **Ad Interactions:** Information on how you interact with the ads shown in the App.
*   **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data related to the Ads SDK.

This information is used by Google to provide advertising and measure its performance. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob. We encourage you to review **[How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)**.

#### b) Google Play Games Services (Achievements, Leaderboards & Cloud Save)
This is an **optional** service you can sign into. If you choose to sign in, Google will handle certain data to provide game features:

*   **Your public Google Play Games profile information** (e.g., Gamer ID and avatar) may be visible to other players on leaderboards.
*   **Your game activity,** such as your scores (for leaderboards) and unlocked achievements.
*   **Your game save file** is uploaded to Google's servers for the Cloud Save feature.

This service is governed by the **[Google Play Games Services Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)** and the main **[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)**.

### 3. In-App Benefits & Data Storage

*   **Temporary Ad Removal (Ad-Free Period):** You may choose to watch a rewarded advertisement in exchange for removing banner ads for a 24-hour period. This ad-free status is stored **locally on your device** and is **not synced** via Cloud Save. If you reinstall the App, clear its data, or switch to a new device, this temporary benefit will not be restored.

*   **Cloud Save (Optional):** If you sign in to Google Play Games, your progress (score, gems, unlocked items, etc.) is automatically saved to the cloud. If you install the App on a new device and sign in with the same account, your progress will be restored. If there is a conflict between your local save and your cloud save, you will be prompted to choose which one to keep.

*   **Data Loss Without Cloud Save:** If you **do not** sign in to Google Play Games, all your game progress is stored **exclusively on your device**. If you uninstall the App, switch to a new device, or clear the App's data, this information **will be permanently lost and cannot be restored.**

### 4. Your Control and Opt-Out Choices

You have direct control over your data.

*   **Personalized Advertising:** You can opt out of personalized advertising at any time.
    1.  Open your device's **Settings** app.
    2.  Navigate to **Google** > **Ads**.
    3.  Tap **"Delete advertising ID"** and confirm.
    You may still see ads, but they will be generic and not based on your interests.

*   **Google Play Games Services:** You can disconnect the App from Google Play Games Services at any time through the Google Settings on your device or within the Google Play Games app. Doing so will disable Cloud Save, Leaderboards, and Achievements.

### 5. Children's Privacy

This App is intended for a general audience, including children. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable regulations like GDPR-K.

*   We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction).
*   The data collected by our partners (Google AdMob) is for operational purposes, such as serving contextual ads (not behaviorally-targeted ads for child-directed content) and frequency capping.
*   Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their children's use of the App and to utilize the advertising opt-out controls described in Section 4.

### 6. Security

Game data is stored on your device's internal storage and is protected by your device's security. If you use Google Play Games Services, your data is also protected by Google's industry-standard security infrastructure.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on its store listing. We recommend you review this policy periodically.
